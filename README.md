**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### What I learned

I mainly learned to pratice in a real use case situation to use flexboxes and to build a responsive site (at least partially) with media queries

### Continued development

I want to refine the responsive part, to have in every situation a site or component that react well

### Useful resources

- [Flexfox froggy](https://flexboxfroggy.com/#fr) - Flexboxes explained as a game, it helped me to understand how to use them
